1. Tell me about yourself.
=> Hello,

My name is Shital Bhandare, and I hail from the Sangli District. 
With over 9 years of experience in the software industry, I specialize in back-end development. 
I hold a degree in Computer Science from Walchand College, Sangli, and a post-graduate degree in Software Systems from BITS Pilani.

I am currently employed at Druva Data Solutions in Pune. 
Prior to this, I worked at Veritas, now known as Arctera.io. 
Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in various technologies and programming languages, including GoLang, Python, C, and AWS services.

In my most recent role at Druva, I was a member of the Realize team. 
My responsibilities included leading a team of 5-6 members and managing end-to-end feature ownership, from requirement gathering and impact analysis to design (HLD, LLD), development, code review of junior engineers, dev testing (UT/CT addition), deployment, and maintenance. 
This role required collaboration with PM, UX, UI, cross-team dev/QA, DevOps, CloudOps, and other teams.

I am seeking a similar role where I can contribute to innovative projects.


2. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.
=> There was a time when release was approaching. We were crunching on QA bandwidth. So manager suggested to release the feature without automation but only with Manual testing.
I was not agree with this decision becuase automation gives us the confidence and way to check for any regression.
I discussed with him about this and we delayed the relases. We esured that automation and manual testing is complete.
Note: Add some more points to this while discussing.


3. Tell me about a situation when you had a conflict with a teammate.
=> Yes.
Tell recent example of Safe Mode where to add validation check ..CPortal or Master Service..Check in validate_download and download cases.
My opinion: Master service and download() only
Teammate opinion: CPortal and validate_download and download() both
LLD review: Discussed with Architects and agreed on my approach.


4. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?
=> Yes. First 6 months were critical in Druva. Joined in lockdown period. Culture, process and release difference in Veritas and Druva. 
Had difficulty in managing. 1 month went in onboarding and later had lockdown. Lowest perfomance, less increment.
Had talk with manager. Took the feedback constructively, positively and did bmy best. I had promotions, team switches and handled projects well.

5. Describe a time when you led a team. What was the outcome?
=> Realize Fedramp release. Team of 2 dev and 1 QA. Involved cross teams communication
Initiated first discussion with all stakeholders. Mangers helped to create virtual team. Created all communication channel.
Frequent follow ups with team. Guided junior engineers. Dig deeper and followed whatever required.
Documented very well that got email from Cross team about appreciation.


6. Tell me about a time you worked well under pressure.
=> Hydra project release for multi cloud deployments. Had to do under pressure because of tight deadlines. Did it successfully.
