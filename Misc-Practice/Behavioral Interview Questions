1. Tell me about yourself.
=> Hello,

My name is Shital Bhandare, and I hail from the Sangli District. 
With over 9 years of experience in the software industry, I specialize in back-end development. 
I hold a degree in Computer Science from Walchand College, Sangli, and a post-graduate degree in Software Systems from BITS Pilani.

I am currently employed at Druva Data Solutions in Pune. 
Prior to this, I worked at Veritas, now known as Arctera.io. 
Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in various technologies and programming languages, including GoLang, Python, C, and AWS services.

In my most recent role at Druva, I was a member of the Realize team. 
My responsibilities included leading a team of 5-6 members and managing end-to-end feature ownership, from requirement gathering and impact analysis to design (HLD, LLD), development, code review of junior engineers, dev testing (UT/CT addition), deployment, and maintenance. 
This role required collaboration with PM, UX, UI, cross-team dev/QA, DevOps, CloudOps, and other teams.

I am seeking a similar role where I can contribute to innovative projects.


2. Tell me about a time you had a disagreement with your manager.
=> There was a time when release was approaching. We were crunching on QA bandwidth. So manager suggested to release the feature without automation but only with Manual testing.
I was not agree with this decision becuase automation gives us the confidence and way to check for any regression.
I discussed with him about this and we delayed the relases. We esured that automation and manual testing is complete.
Note: Add some more points to this while discussing.
